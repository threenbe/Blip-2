# Blip-2
Extra functionality for the [Blip](https://github.com/threenbe/Blip) project.

Implemented if-else statements and loops, wasn't able to implement functions. The implementation is not completely perfect if I recall correctly, but it was decent enough.

There are 2 attempts uploaded here. The first was rather poor, the second was better (albeit imperfect) and a lot more sensible as well.
